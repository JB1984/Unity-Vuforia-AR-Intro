# UnityVuforiaARIntro
This repository is a intro tutorial for people interested in starting to use Unity and Vuforia for AR applications.

I am going to assume that you have Unity3D already installed on your computers and that you have a basic level of understanding of the Unity editor and C# scripting. In this tutorial we do not do anything too complex with either the editor or scripting so dont worry if you are still relatively new.
