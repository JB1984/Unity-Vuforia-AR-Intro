This repository is a intro tutorial for people interested in starting to use Unity and Vuforia for AR applications.

If you do not have Unity installed go to www.unity3d.com and install it. As I write this the latest version of Unity for Windows is 5.5.1f1

Next thing that you will need is the Vuforia SDK for Unity. Go to https://developer.vuforia.com/ and register for a free account.

You will want to "Download for Unity", as I write this the latest Vuforia version is 6.2.10.
